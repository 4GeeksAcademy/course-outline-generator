name: 4geeks-transversal-project-readme-generator
description: Generates the universal project statement (README.md + README.es.md) for a single milestone of a 4Geeks Academy transversal project. The README is written in generic "your company" framing — no sector, no company name — so it applies equally to every student regardless of their assigned scenario. Use this skill when a milestone needs a new README from scratch, or when an existing README needs to be rewritten. Trigger on phrases like "write the README for milestone N", "create the project statement for hito X", "generate the universal statement for this milestone", or "rewrite the milestone README". Do NOT use this skill to generate CONTEXT files — use 4geeks-transversal-context-generator for that.

# 4Geeks Academy — Transversal README Generator

Generates `README.md` + `README.es.md` for one milestone of a transversal project. The output is a universal project statement: technically precise, professionally framed, and written with no reference to any specific company or sector. Every student receives the same README regardless of which company scenario they have been assigned.

## Step 1 — Collect Required Inputs

Confirm all inputs before generating. If any are missing, ask for all of them at once — never in multiple rounds.

| Input                | Description                                                               | Default                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `milestone_number`   | The milestone number (e.g., `6`)                                          | — Must ask —                                           |
| `milestone_topic`    | Core skill(s) this milestone teaches (e.g., `Telemetry & Data Pipelines`) | — Must ask —                                           |
| `milestone_position` | Position in the course: `early`, `mid`, or `late`                         | — Must ask —                                           |
| `prior_milestones`   | What students have already built in previous milestones                   | — Must ask —                                           |
| `tech_stack`         | Technologies required (e.g., `FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Next.js`)            | — Must ask —                                           |
| `template_repo`      | Starter repo URL students will fork                                       | `https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/transversal-project` |
| `authors`            | GitHub username(s) for the metadata block                                 | — Must ask —                                           |

## Step 2 — Authoring Rules

### Voice and framing

Write in second person, direct professional tone. The company is always "your company". Stakeholders are always generic: "your tech lead", "your CTO", "your manager". Never name a sector, industry, company, or technology that is not part of the required stack.

**Do:** `Your company has been running on gut feeling for too long.`
**Don't:** `Nexova Solutions needs a pipeline.` / `The logistics company requires tracking.`

### The CONTEXT anchor — mandatory

The README must reference `CONTEXT-company.md` (link to https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineeirng-milestone-contexts) in exactly two places:

1. **In the hidden metadata block** — a note before the student starts.
2. **In the task checklist** — a `⚠️ IMPORTANT` warning that a generic implementation ignoring the context will not be accepted.

This is the mechanism that enforces contextualization. Without it, students treat the README as a standalone assignment and ignore their scenario.

### Embed requirements in prose

The challenge narrative must contain at least two or three requirements that the student has to extract by reading carefully — not everything goes in checklists. This mirrors how real briefs work.

### Prior milestone continuity

If this is not milestone 1, open with one sentence acknowledging what was built before and how this milestone extends it. Do not re-explain prior work.

> You've already built the API and the authentication layer. Now your company needs to understand what's happening inside that system in real time.

### Complementary knowledge

If the milestone requires operational context not covered in lessons (e.g., what makes a good dashboard, what an SLA is), add a brief focused subsection inside the challenge. Keep it under 150 words. Label it clearly.

## Step 3 — Structure

Follow this structure exactly, in this order:

```markdown
1. Milestone Title (e.g., "Milestone 6 — Telemetry & Data Pipelines")
2. Hidden metadata block
3. --- separator
4. The Challenge (🎯)
   └── [optional] complementary knowledge subsection
   └── CTO/manager brief in nested blockquotes
5. How to Start the Project (🌱)
6. What You Need to Do (💻) — checklist
7. What We Will Evaluate (✅) — checklist
8. How to Submit (📦)
9. --- separator + Footer
```

### Hidden metadata block template

_Estas instrucciones están [disponibles en español](./README.es.md)._

**Before you start**: Read your **[CONTEXT-company.md](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineeirng-milestone-contexts)** before writing any code — it defines the specific company data, field names, KPIs, and constraints for your implementation.

<!-- endhide -->
```

### CONTEXT warning for the task checklist

Place this after any checklist group whose implementation depends on context data:

```markdown
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Field names, entity IDs, and domain-specific values in your implementation must match what is specified in your CONTEXT.md. A generic implementation that ignores the context will not be accepted.
```

### Checklist format

Use `- [ ]` for every item in both checklists. Group task items by layer (backend, frontend, data, testing). Evaluation criteria must be observable and measurable — not vague qualities.

✅ `The pipeline has three identifiable stages implemented as separate functions`
❌ `Good code quality`

### Footer templates

## Step 4 — Bilingual Output

READMEs are delivered in two stages:

**Stage 1 — Primary document (working language):** Generate the primary language version first and deliver it for review. Do not generate the translation until the primary document has been explicitly approved. The primary language is the working language of the course — typically Spanish, unless the user specifies otherwise.

**Stage 2 — Translation (after approval):** Once the primary document is approved, generate the translation. The translation must be a faithful, consistent rendering — same structure, same section order, same wording intent. Do not add, remove, or reword requirements between versions.

Each file must link to its counterpart, written in the language of the target document — so a reader who does not understand the current document can still find the translation:

- In `README.md` (English): `_Estas instrucciones están [disponibles en español](./README.es.md)._`
- In `README.es.md` (Spanish): `_These instructions are [available in English](./README.md)._`

## Quality Self-Check Before Delivering

- [ ] No sector name, company name, or industry reference anywhere in the README
- [ ] CONTEXT anchor present in both the metadata block and the task checklist
- [ ] At least two or three requirements embedded in the challenge narrative (not only in checklists)
- [ ] Prior milestone continuity sentence present (if not milestone 1)
- [ ] Complementary knowledge subsection present if the milestone requires context not in lessons
- [ ] All checklist items use `- [ ]` format
- [ ] Evaluation criteria are observable and measurable
- [ ] Primary language document generated and delivered for review before translation begins
- [ ] Translation generated only after explicit approval of the primary document
- [ ] Translation is structurally identical to the approved primary — same requirements, same checklist items, same order
- [ ] Both README.md and README.es.md link to each other (once both exist)
- [ ] Footer present in both files with correct language variant
