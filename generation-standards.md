# Course Outline Generation Standards

Comprehensive methodology for generating 4Geeks Academy course outlines.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE - READ FIRST ⚠️

### ONE LEARNPACK = ONE `+` BLOCK (NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Each line starting with `+` in syllabus.md is a SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT learnpack.**

**PRE-GENERATION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] User specified EXACT `+` block name? (e.g., "HTML" not "Skill 1")
- [ ] Found the specific `+` line in syllabus.md?
- [ ] Extracted ONLY the `-` bullets under THAT `+` block?
- [ ] Stopped at the NEXT `+` line? (Did NOT continue past it)
- [ ] Confirmed ZERO content from other `+` blocks is included?
- [ ] Can quote the EXACT `+` line being used?

**If ANY box is unchecked, STOP and ask user for clarification.**

---

### Bad vs Good Examples

❌ **WRONG - Mixing Multiple `+` Blocks:**
```
User: "Generate Week 1 Skill 1"
Claude: [sees HTML + CSS + Accesibilidad under Skill 1]
Claude: [generates one massive course combining all three]
```

✅ **CORRECT - One `+` Block Only:**
```
User: "Generate Week 1 Skill 1"
Claude: "I found 3 separate learnapacks under Skill 1:"
        "1. + HTML"
        "2. + CSS"  
        "3. + Accesibilidad web"
        "Which ONE should I generate?"
User: "HTML"
Claude: [generates course using ONLY the bullets under + HTML]
```

❌ **WRONG - Assuming Which Block:**
```
User: "Generate the frontend basics course"
Claude: [picks random + block without asking]
```

✅ **CORRECT - Always Confirm:**
```
User: "Generate the frontend basics course"
Claude: "I found several learnapacks that could fit. Please specify the EXACT + block name from syllabus.md"
```

## Core Philosophy

**4Geeks Educational Principles:**
- **Vibecoding** (vibemanifesto.org): Iteration over perfection, practical learning over theory
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Collaboration between students and AI/instructors
- **Path of least resistance**: Teach simplest solutions first, add complexity only when needed
- **Autonomous problem-solving**: Develop student self-sufficiency
- **Attention to detail**: Cultivate careful reading and observation

**Target Audience:** Beginner developers (typically 18-35, universally accessible content)

---

## Structure Guidelines

### Lesson Count
**Optimize based on content complexity:**
- Simple topics: 15-22 lessons
- Moderate topics: 23-28 lessons
- Complex topics: 29-35 lessons

**Goal:** Match lesson count to actual teaching needs. Never default to a fixed number.

### Section Count
- **Total:** 7-9 sections (including Section 00 and final outro)
- **Section 00:** Welcome/Introduction (1 lesson)
- **Content sections:** 5-7 sections (3-5 lessons each)
- **Second-to-last section:** Assessment (includes 🧠 lesson)
- **Final section:** Outro/Conclusion (exactly 1 lesson only)

---

## Lesson Types and Emoji Markers

**CRITICAL: Every content lesson must have one emoji marker.**

### Conceptual Lessons (📖)
- Theory, explanations, principles, concepts
- Includes anti-pattern lessons (just regular conceptual lessons)
- Word count: ~400-600 words
- **Mark with 📖 emoji**

### Hands-On Lessons (💻)
- Practical application and exercises
- Word count: ~500-700 words
- **Mark with 💻 emoji**

**Distribution guidelines:**
- Practical courses (coding, tools): 40-50% hands-on
- Conceptual courses (theory, strategy): 20-30% hands-on
- Mixed courses: 30-40% hands-on

**Flexibility:** These are guidelines. Some subjects naturally need more/less practice. Ask: "Does this % make sense for THIS topic?"

### Assessment Lessons (🧠)
- 5-7 questions (multiple choice OR scenario-based, not mixed)
- Include in second-to-last section
- Word count: ~600-800 words
- **Mark with 🧠 emoji**

### Outro Lessons
- Final section only (exactly 1 lesson)
- No emoji marker needed
- No theory, no exercises, no assessment
- Word count: ~400-450 words
- Content: Course recap, next steps, resources, encouragement

---

## Anti-Pattern Lessons

Anti-patterns are regular conceptual lessons (📖) that teach what NOT to do.

**Distribution:**
- Short courses (15-22 lessons): 1 anti-pattern
- Medium courses (23-28 lessons): 2 anti-patterns
- Long courses (29+ lessons): 2-3 anti-patterns

**Placement:** Always AFTER teaching the correct approach

**Content:**
- Clear anti-pattern examples
- Consequences of each anti-pattern
- Correct approach shown side-by-side
- Explanation of why the anti-pattern is common/tempting

---

## Word Count Guidelines

| Lesson Type | Word Count | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Conceptual (📖) | 400-600 | Understanding principles |
| Hands-on (💻) | 500-700 | Practical application |
| Assessment (🧠) | 600-800 | Testing comprehension |
| Outro | 400-450 | Reflection and next steps |

**Total Course:** Lesson count × 500 (e.g., 26 lessons = ~13,000 words)

**Acceptable variance:** ±2,000 words from target

---

## Syllabus-Based Generation Rules

### Understanding the Syllabus Structure

**Learnpack blocks:** Lines starting with `+` (e.g., `+ HTML Basics`)
- Each `+` block is a separate, independent learnpack
- Content: Indented `-` lines following the `+` block
- Boundary: Stops at the next `+` line (new learnpack starts)

### ⚠️ MANDATORY RULE: One Learnpack Per Generation

**THE PROCESS:**

1. **User requests a course** (e.g., "Generate Week 1 Skill 1")

2. **YOU MUST:**
   - Locate the Skill section in syllabus.md
   - List ALL `+` blocks found under that Skill
   - Ask: "I found these learnapacks: [list all + blocks]. Which ONE should I generate?"
   - Wait for user to specify the EXACT `+` block name

3. **Find the EXACT `+` line user requests**
   - Example: User says "HTML" → Find `+ HTML` line

4. **Extract ONLY the `-` lines under that `+`**
   - Start: First `-` after the `+` line
   - Stop: Immediately when you hit the NEXT `+` line
   - Result: A list of required topics for THIS learnpack only

5. **VERIFY before proceeding:**
   ```
   ✓ Extracted from one `+` block only?
   ✓ Stopped at next `+` line?
   ✓ Zero content from other `+` blocks?
   ```

**NEVER:**
- Combine multiple `+` blocks into one generation
- Continue past the next `+` line
- Assume which `+` block user wants
- Generate without explicit `+` block confirmation

### Example Extraction

```markdown
Skill 1: Frontend Basics

+ HTML
    - Main tags
    - Semantic HTML
    - Best practices
+ CSS
    - Flexbox
    - DRY in CSS
    - Selectors
```

**User:** "Generate Week 1 Skill 1"

**YOU RESPOND:**
"I found 2 learnapacks under Skill 1:
1. + HTML
2. + CSS

Which ONE should I generate?"

**User:** "HTML"

**YOU EXTRACT:**
```
+ HTML
    - Main tags
    - Semantic HTML  
    - Best practices
[STOP HERE - next line is + CSS]
```

**YOU GENERATE:** A complete course covering these 3 topics only.

---

### Understanding Coverage Requirements

**The `-` bullet points are REQUIRED TOPICS, not structural templates.**

**Correct approach:** Design the optimal course structure (maybe 6-8 sections) ensuring these topics are covered within it.

**Wrong approach:** Create one section per bullet point.

**Example:**
```
+ HTML
    - Main tags
    - Semantic HTML
    - Best practices
```

✅ Design optimal HTML course (6-8 sections) covering these 3 required topics
❌ Create exactly 3 sections matching the bullets

### Examining Context

**Always check:**
- **ALL previous learnapacks:** What has been taught so far in the syllabus? (avoid repetition)
- **Upcoming learnapacks:** What's coming later in the curriculum? (avoid premature coverage)
- **Learning progression:** Where does this learnpack fit in the complete journey?

**How to examine:**
- Review all `+` blocks from Week 1 up to the current learnpack
- Review `+` blocks coming after the current learnpack
- Note specific topics and concepts that have been covered
- Note topics that are scheduled for later (don't teach them prematurely)

---

## Lesson Design Requirements

### Every Conceptual Lesson (📖) Must Include:
1. Learning Objectives (2-4 specific, measurable outcomes)
2. Content Outline (main topics to be covered)
3. Transitions (connection to previous/next lessons)
4. Key Principles (2-4 core concepts)
5. Examples (2-3 concrete illustrations)

### Every Hands-On Lesson (💻) Must Include:
1. Learning Objectives (2-4 specific, measurable outcomes)
2. Content Outline (main topics to be covered)
3. Transitions (connection to previous/next lessons)
4. Key Principles (2-4 core concepts)
5. Examples (2-3 concrete illustrations)
6. Hands-On Exercise or Practice Challenge
7. Code examples or Practice scenario
8. Success criteria or Expected outcomes

### Every Assessment Lesson (🧠) Must Include:
1. Learning Objectives (2-4 specific, measurable outcomes)
2. Question format (multiple choice OR scenario-based, not mixed)
3. 5-7 questions covering full course
4. Evaluation criteria
5. Score interpretation

### Every Outro Lesson Must Include:
- Course recap (what students accomplished)
- Connection to bigger picture
- Next steps and continued learning
- Resources for further exploration
- Encouragement and celebration

**Note:** Outro has NO learning objectives, NO exercises, NO theory, NO assessment.

## Quality Checklist

### Structure
- [ ] Lesson count optimized for content (15-35 range, not default)
- [ ] 7-9 total sections
- [ ] Logical progression (simple → complex)
- [ ] Each content section has 3-5 lessons
- [ ] Anti-patterns (📖) placed AFTER teaching correct approach
- [ ] Hands-on percentage matches course type
- [ ] Assessment (🧠) in second-to-last section
- [ ] Final section has exactly 1 lesson (outro only)
- [ ] Every content lesson marked with emoji (📖, 💻, or 🧠)

### Content
- [ ] Specific learning objectives (not vague)
- [ ] Concrete, relevant examples
- [ ] Logical transitions between lessons
- [ ] Key principles aligned with 4Geeks philosophy
- [ ] No repetition from ANY previous learnapacks in syllabus (full context examined)
- [ ] No premature coverage of topics scheduled for later learnapacks

### Lesson Balance
- [ ] Appropriate mix of conceptual/hands-on for subject matter
- [ ] 1-3 anti-pattern lessons (📖) properly placed
- [ ] One assessment lesson (🧠) in second-to-last section
- [ ] Single outro lesson concludes course

### Word Counts
- [ ] Conceptual (📖): 400-600 words
- [ ] Hands-on (💻): 500-700 words
- [ ] Assessment (🧠): 600-800 words
- [ ] Outro: 400-450 words
- [ ] Total: ±2,000 words from target

### Syllabus Compliance
- [ ] Extracted from ONE `+` block only
- [ ] Stopped at next `+` line
- [ ] User confirmed which `+` block to use
- [ ] All `-` bullets from that block covered
- [ ] No content from other `+` blocks included

---

## Assessment Approach

**Good Review = Educational Quality Assessment**
- Does content flow naturally?
- Will students retain this information?
- Is practice placed effectively?
- Does the structure serve the subject matter?

**Bad Review = Rigid Compliance Checking**
- Are percentages exact?
- Do numbers match arbitrary rules?
- Does it check all boxes regardless of context?

**Remember:** Guidelines exist to promote quality, not restrict it. If something breaks a guideline but improves learning, it's good design.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### DON'T:
- Mix content from multiple `+` blocks in syllabus mode
- Generate without confirming which `+` block user wants
- Continue past the next `+` line in syllabus
- Use the same lesson count for every course (optimize each time)
- Create sections with only 1-2 lessons (except intro/outro)
- Place anti-patterns before teaching the correct approach
- Write vague objectives ("understand X", "learn about Y")
- Mix multiple-choice and scenario questions in assessments
- Forget emoji markers on content lessons (📖, 💻, 🧠)
- Add theory or exercises to outro lesson
- Have multiple lessons in final section
- Invent content for framework sections marked as "Not introduced"

### DO:
- Ask user to specify EXACT `+` block name from syllabus
- Extract from ONE `+` block only (verify before proceeding)
- Stop immediately at the next `+` line
- List all available `+` blocks if user request is ambiguous
- Optimize lesson count based on actual content needs
- Vary content section sizes appropriately (3-5 lessons)
- Place anti-patterns after students know the correct approach
- Write specific, measurable learning objectives
- Choose ONE assessment format per lesson (not mixed)
- Include clear practice tasks for all hands-on lessons
- Mark every content lesson with appropriate emoji
- End with single outro lesson only (no content, no exercises)
- Examine ALL previous learnapacks to avoid repetition
- Examine upcoming learnapacks to avoid premature coverage
- Design optimal structure (don't map 1:1 to bullet points)

---

## Two-Step Generation Process

### Step 1: Identify and Confirm the Learnpack (MANDATORY)

**When user requests generation:**

1. **Locate the section** in syllabus.md
2. **List ALL `+` blocks** found in that section
3. **Ask user:** "I found these learnapacks: [list]. Which ONE should I generate?"
4. **Wait for user** to specify EXACT `+` block name
5. **Confirm extraction:**
   - "Generating [+block name] only"
   - "Topics to cover: [list - bullets]"
   - "Proceed with simple structure?"

**NEVER skip this confirmation step, even if only one `+` block exists.**

### Step 2: Simple Structure (Always Before Detail)

Present concise overview:
- Course title and source
- Total lessons (optimized number)
- Section breakdown WITH lesson titles and emoji markers
- Lesson distribution percentages
- Word count estimates
- **Wait for approval**

**Template:**
```markdown

## Final Reminders

1. **Always generate in English only** (translate Spanish topics)
2. **One learnpack = one generation** (never mix `+` blocks)
3. **Ask user which `+` block** if request is ambiguous
4. **Simple structure first** (with subsections and emoji markers)
5. **Wait for approval** before full generation
6. **Every lesson needs emoji** (📖, 💻, or 🧠) except outro
7. **Final section = 1 lesson only** (outro with no content/exercises)
8. **Examine context** (ALL previous and upcoming learnapacks)
9. **Optimize lesson count** (don't default to fixed numbers)
10. **Guidelines are flexible** (serve educational quality, not arbitrary rules)

---

## Pre-Generation Final Verification

**Before presenting ANY structure, answer:**

1. ✓ Did user specify which `+` block? (If no → ASK)
2. ✓ Am I extracting from ONE `+` block only? (Count = 1)
3. ✓ Did I stop at the next `+` line? (No content beyond it)
4. ✓ Can I quote the EXACT `+` line I'm using? (Be specific)
5. ✓ Examined previous learnapacks for context? (Avoid repetition)
6. ✓ Examined upcoming learnapacks for context? (Avoid premature topics)

**If any answer is NO, STOP and resolve before proceeding.**
